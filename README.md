<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
Modern IDEs will use the package.json to import things successfully using npm,
as listing all the packages would take too long here.
Expo Go is used to run and preview the app from source code.
To use Firebase successfully, you must create your own Firebase and put the key for that in the Firebase config file.
